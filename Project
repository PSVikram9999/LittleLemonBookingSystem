To successfully complete and submit your Little Lemon Booking System project for peer review, follow these steps:

### Project Submission Checklist:

1. **Create a MySQL Database:**
   - Design and implement a database schema using MySQL Workbench that includes tables to store booking data and any other relevant information.
   - Ensure the schema supports the functionality required for managing bookings (e.g., customers, bookings, availability).

2. **Populate Database:**
   - Insert sample booking data into your MySQL database for testing purposes. This can be done manually using SQL INSERT statements or through scripts.

3. **Implement Procedures:**
   - Use Python to connect to your MySQL database.
   - Implement procedures/functions (`GetMaxQuantity`, `ManageBooking`, `UpdateBooking`, `AddBooking`, `CancelBooking`) to interact with the database and manage booking operations.

4. **Connect Tableau:**
   - Connect Tableau to your MySQL database to access and analyze the booking data.
   - Create visualizations and dashboards in Tableau to demonstrate your ability to analyze and present data effectively.

5. **Prepare Documentation and Diagrams:**
   - Generate relevant diagrams such as an ER diagram (Entity-Relationship diagram) showing the structure and relationships of your database tables.
   - Capture screenshots of your Tableau dashboards and any other relevant outputs in PNG format.

6. **GitHub Repository Setup:**
   - Create a new GitHub repository to host your project.
   - Structure your repository to include folders for documentation, SQL files, Python scripts, Tableau workbooks, and any other necessary files.

7. **Commit and Push to GitHub:**
   - Initialize a git repository in your project folder (if not already initialized):
     ```bash
     git init
     ```
   - Add all project files to the repository:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit the files with a descriptive message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial commit: Added database schema, Python scripts, and Tableau workbook"
     ```
   - Link your local repository to the GitHub remote repository you created:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin <repository_url>
     ```
     Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository.
   - Push the commits to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin master
     ```

8. **Write README.md:**
   - Create a `README.md` file in your repository with detailed instructions on:
     - How to set up and initialize the database.
     - Steps to run and test the Python scripts.
     - Instructions for connecting Tableau to the database and using the workbooks.
     - Any additional information about your project structure, design decisions, and data analysis insights.

9. **Submit for Peer Review:**
   - Share the GitHub repository link with your peers for review.
   - Ensure all required components (diagrams, SQL schema file, Tableau workbook) are accessible and well-documented.

### Peer Review Instructions:

1. **Evaluate Peer Projects:**
   - Review two projects submitted by your peers according to the criteria provided.
   - Assess if the GitHub repository was successfully created and structured.
   - Check if the database schema, procedures/functions, and Tableau analysis meet the project specifications.
   - Provide constructive feedback on the design, implementation, and documentation.
   - Suggest improvements or highlight any issues found with recommendations for corrections.

By following these steps, you can prepare and submit your Little Lemon Booking System project effectively for peer review, ensuring clarity, completeness, and adherence to the project requirements.
